# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

## About
* Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a crucial metric for companies like SoFi (Social Finance). SoFi is a modern finance company that provides a range of financial products and services, including student loan refinancing, personal loans, mortgages, investing, and banking. CLV helps SoFi understand the long-term value that each customer brings to the company, enabling them to make informed decisions about customer acquisition, retention, and overall business strategy. <br>
* SoFi's business model revolves around building long-term relationships with its customers. By offering a diverse range of financial products and services, they aim to become a one-stop solution for their customers' financial needs. To achieve this, SoFi needs to identify and segment their customers based on their behavior patterns and preferences. **This is where RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) and CLV prediction play a vital role.**
* RFM analysis is a method used to segment customers based on their purchase behavior. It evaluates three key aspects:
   * Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase or interacted with the company.
   * Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases or interacts with the company.
   * Monetary: The monetary value of a customer's purchases or interactions with the company.
* By analyzing these three dimensions, SoFi can gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. For example, customers who have recently interacted with SoFi, make frequent transactions, and have a high monetary value contribute significantly to CLV. These customers can be considered as high-value or loyal customers who require special attention to maintain their satisfaction and loyalty.
* Once the customers are segmented based on RFM analysis, CLV prediction comes into play. CLV prediction involves estimating the future value that a customer will bring to the company over their entire relationship. It takes into account factors such as average transaction value, purchase frequency, retention rate, and customer churn rate. By predicting CLV, SoFi can identify customers with high growth potential, prioritize resources for customer acquisition efforts, and tailor management strategies accordingly.
* Segmenting customers and predicting CLV allows SoFi to apply appropriate management strategies for different customer segments. For instance:
  * High-value customers: SoFi can offer personalized services, exclusive benefits, and targeted marketing campaigns to enhance customer loyalty and retention. This may include providing access to premium features, tailored financial advice, or priority customer support.
  * Potential high-value customers: Customers who show potential for high future value but have not yet reached that level can be nurtured through targeted marketing efforts, upselling or cross-selling relevant products, and providing incentives to increase their engagement.
  * Low-value or at-risk customers: Customers who have low CLV or are at risk of churning can be targeted with retention campaigns, personalized offers, and proactive customer service to improve their satisfaction and increase their likelihood of staying with SoFi.
* **By leveraging RFM analysis and CLV prediction, SoFi can optimize its customer acquisition, retention, and resource allocation strategies. It enables them to identify valuable customers, understand their behavior patterns, and tailor their services to meet their needs effectively, ultimately driving long-term growth and profitability.**
